Keep then exit

systemctl start autofs

systemctl enable autofs

su - ldapuserX// test

If the above solutions cannot create files or the command prompt is -bash-4.2$, it maybe exist multi-level

directory, this needs to change the server.domain11.example.com:/home/guests/ to

server.domain11.example.com:/home/guests/ldapuserX. What is multi-level directory? It means there is a

One Domain RHCE is configured in your lab, your domain server is server1.example.com. nisuser2001,

nisuser2002, nisuser2003 user are created on your server 192.168.0.254:/rhome/stationx/nisuser2001. Make

sure that when NIS user login in your system automatically mount the home directory. Home directory is

separately shared on server /rhome/stationx/ where x is your Station number.A. See explanation below.

use the authconfig --nisserver=<NIS SERVER> --nisdomain=<NIS DOMAIN> -- update

Example: authconfig --niserver=192.168.0.254 --nisdomain=RHCE --update or system-config-

authentication Click on Enable NIS

Type the NIS Domain: RHCE

Type Server 192.168.0.254 then click on next and ok

You will get a ok message.

Create a Directory /rhome/stationx where x is your station number.

vi /etc/auto.master and write at the end of file /rhome/stationx /etc/auto.home --timeout=60

vi /etc/auto.home and write

* -rw,soft,intr 192.168.0.254:/rhome/stationx/&

Note: please specify your station number in the place of x.

Service autofs restart

Login as the nisuser2001 or nisuser2002 on another terminal will be Success. According to question,

RHCE domain is already configured. We have to make a client of RHCE domain and automatically mount

the home directory on your system. To make a member of domain, we use the authconfig with option or

system- config authentication command. There a are lots of authentication server i.e NIS, LDAB, SMB etc.

NIS is a RPC related Services, no need to configure the DNS, we should specify the NIS server address.

Here Automount feature is available. When user tried to login, home directory will automatically mount. The

automount service used the /etc/auto.master file. On

/etc/auto.master file we specified the mount point the configuration file for mount point.
