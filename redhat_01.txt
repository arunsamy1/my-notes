Explanation/Reference:

Explanation: The LVM system organizes hard disks into Logical Volume (LV) groups. Essentially, physical hard

disk partitions (or possibly RAID arrays) are set up in a bunch of equal sized chunks known as Physical Extents

(PE). As there are several other concepts associated with the LVM system, let's start with some basic

definitions:

Physical Volume (PV) is the standard partition that you add to the LVM mix. Normally, a physical volume is a

standard primary or logical partition. It can also be a RAID array.

Physical Extent (PE) is a chunk of disk space. Every PV is divided into a number of equal sized PEs. Every PE

in a LV group is the same size. Different LV groups can have different sized PEs.

Logical Extent (LE) is also a chunk of disk space. Every LE is mapped to a specific PE.

Logical Volume (LV) is composed of a group of LEs. You can mount a file system such as /home and /var on

an LV.

Volume Group (VG) is composed of a group of LVs. It is the organizational group for LVM. Most of the

commands that you'll use apply to a specific VG.

Verify the size of Logical Volume: lvdisplay /dev/vg0/lv1

Verify the Size on mounted directory: df -h or df -h mounted directory name

Use: lvextend -L+400M /dev/vg0/lv1

ext2online -d /dev/vg0/lv1 to bring extended size online.

Again Verify using lvdisplay and df -h command.
