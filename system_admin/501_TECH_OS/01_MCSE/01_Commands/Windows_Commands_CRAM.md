**_Linux Principles_**

List the Basic Principles of Linux Operating system:

1.  Everything is a file
2.  Configuration Data stored in text files
3.  Small, single purpose programs
4.  Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks
5.  Avoids captive user interface

**_1._** **Everything is a file :**

Linux systems have many powerful utilities designed to create and manipulate files. The Linux security model is based around the security of files. By treating everything as a file, a consistency emerges. You can secure access to hardware in the same way as you secure access to a file.

**_2._** **Configuration Data stored in Text:**

Text is a universal interface, and many Linux utilities exist to manipulate text. Storing configuration in text allows an administrator to move a configuration from one machine to another easily. There are several revision control applications that enable an administrator to track which change was made on a particular day, and provide the ability to roll back the system configuration to a particular date and time.

**_3._** **Small, single purpose programs:**

Linux provides many small utilities that perform a single task very well. When new functionality is required, the general philosophy is to create a separate program – rather than to extend an existing utility with new features.

**_4_. Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks:**

The core design feature of Linux is that the output of one program can be the input for another. This gives the user the flexibility to combine many small programs together to perform a larger, more complex task.

**_5._** **Avoid Captive user interface.**

Interactive commands are rare in Linux. Most commands expect their options and arguments to be typed on the command line when the command is launched. The command completes normally, possibly producing output, or generates an error message and quits.  Interactivity is reserved for programs where it makes sense, for example, text editors.
