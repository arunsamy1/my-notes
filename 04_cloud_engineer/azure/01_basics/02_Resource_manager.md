**Azure Resource Manager**

 - Azure Resource Manager provides a management layer to create, update, and delete
resources in your Azure account
- We use management features, like access control, locks, and tags, to secure and
organize your resources after deployment.
- When a user sends a request from any of the tools, APIs, SDKs, the Resource
Manager receives the request and authenticates/authorizes it.
- Then it sends to azure services to take action. Since it acts as a central point, it leads
to consistent results.
