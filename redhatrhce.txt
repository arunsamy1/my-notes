RHCE Test Configuration Instructions

Information for the two systems you will use in test is the following:

system1.group3.example.com: is one of the main sever. system2.group3.example.com:

mainly used as a client.

Password for both of the two systems is atenorth

System’s IP is provided by DHCP, you can regard it as normal, or you can reset to Static IP

in accordance with the following requirements:

system1.group3.example.com: 172.24.3.5

system2.group3.example.com: 172.24.3.10

The subnet mask is 255.255.255.0

Your system is a member of DNS domain group3.example.com. All systems in DNS domain

group3.example.com are all in subnet 172.24.3.0/255.255.255.0, the same all systems in this

subnet are also in group3.example.com, unless specialized, all network services required to

be configured can be accessed by systems of domain group3.

host.group3.example.com provides a centralized authentication service domain

GROUP3.EXAMPLE.COM, both system1 and system2 have already been pre-configured to

be the client for this domain, this domain provides the following user account:

Firewall is enabled by default, you can turn it off when deemed appropriate, other settings

about firewall may be in separate requirements.

Your system will be restarted before scoring, so please ensure that all modifications and

service configurations you made still can be operated after the restart without manual

intervention, virtual machine instances of all examinations must be able to enter the correct

multi-user level after restart without manual assistance, it will be scored zero if the test using

virtual machine system cannot be restarted or be properly restarted.

Corresponding distribution packages for the testing using operating system Red Hat

Enterprise Linux version can be found in the following link:

http://server1.group3.example.com/rhel

Part of the requirements include host security, ensure your host security limit does not

prevent the request to allow the host and network, although you correctly configured the

network service but would have to allow the host or network is blocked, this also does not

score.

You will notice that some requirements which clearly do not allow services be accessed by

service domain my133t.org, systems of this domain are in subnet 172.25.1.0/252.255.255.0,

and systems of these subnets also belong to my 133t.org domain.

PS: Notice that some test questions may depend on other exam questions, for example, you

might be asked to perform a series of restrictions on a user, but this user creation may be

required in other questions. For convenient identification, each exam question has some radio

buttions to help you identify which questions you have already completed or not completed.Certainly, you do not need to care these buttions if you don’t need them.

Configure SELINUX

Modify the state of selinux to Enforcing mode.

Configure the SSH Access as required:

Users can visit your two virtual machine systems via clients of domain group3.example.com

through SSH remote.

Answer:

Solution 1:

Modify file /etc/hosts.allow

Add a line: sshd: 172.24.11.

Modify file /etc/hosts.deny

Add a line: sshd: 172.25.0.

Both of them need to be configured.

Solution 2:

Add a firewall

firewall-cmd –zone=block --add-source=172.25.11.0/24 --permanent firewall-cmd –reload

Both of them need to be configured

QUESTION: 34

CORRECT TEXT

Prevent Mary from performing user configuration tasks in your system.

Answer:Conclusions:

1. I find that it is common to add various service access limits in the exam RHCE. The

exercises like: require one network segment can be accessed another network segments can

not be accessed, the following are some conclusions for various service:

tcp_wrappers:/etc/hosts.allow,/etc/hosts.deny

tcp_wrappers can filter the TCP’s accessing service. TCP whether has the filtering function

which depends on this service whether use the function library of tcp_wrappers, or this

service whether has the xinetd process of starting function of tcp_wrappers. tcp_wrappers’s

main configuration file is /etc/hosts.allow,/etc/hosts.deny.

And the priority of the documents in hosts.allow is higher than hosts. deny. Visit will be

passed if no match was found.

sshd,vsftpd can use the filtering service of tcp_wrappers.

Configuration example:

Notice:

The two configuration files’ syntax can refer to hosts_access (5) and hosts_options(5)

sshd_config

There are four parameters in this configuration file: DenyUsers, AllowUsers, DenyGroups,

AllowGroups, they are used to limit some users or user groups to proceed Remote Login

through the SSH. These parameters’ priority level is DenyUsers->AllowUsers->DenyGroups-

>AllowGroups

Configuration example:

httpd Service

Through the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf in parameters, can add <Directory> to control the url

access. Just as:Notice:

So pay attention, deny’s and allow’s priority level in order deny,allow is: the backer has the

higher priority level. But here, allow’s priority has a higher priority level.

nfs Service

nfs service directly control the visits through file /etc/exports, just as:

samba Service

Parameter hosts allow in /etc/samba/smb.conf which is used as Access Control, just as:

2. Paying attention to use Mount parameters: _netdev,defaults when you are mounting ISCSI

disk.

3. Stop the NetworkManager

/etc/init.d/NetworkManager stop

chkconfigNetworkManager off

4. When you are deploying ifcfg-ethX, add parameters:PEERDNS=no

5. Empty the firewall in RHCSA?RHCE:

6. Narrow lv steps:

7. Mount the using command - swap which is newly added in /etc/fstab

8. If Verification is not passed when you are installing software, can import public key: rpm

import /etc/pki/rpm…/…release and so on. In yum.repo, you also can deploy gpgkey, for

example, gpgkey=/etc/pki/rpm…/…release

9. When you are using “Find” command to search and keep these files, paying attention to

use cp -a to copy files if you use user name and authority as your searching methods.

also use the /etc/fstab but filesystem is nfs.

Install the Cron Schedule for jeff user to display "Hello" on daily 5:30.

Answer:

? Login as a root user

? cat >schedule.txt

30 05 * * * /bin/echo "Hello"

? crontab -u jeff schedule.txt

? service crond restart

The cron system is essentially a smart alarm clock. When the alarm sounds, Linux runs the

commands of your choice automatically. You can set the alarm clock to run at all sorts of

regular time intervals. Alternatively, the system allows you to run the command of your

choice once, at a specified time in the future.

Red Hat configured the cron daemon, crond. By default, it checks a series of directories for

jobs to run, every minute of every hour of every day. The crond checks the /var/spool/cron

directory for jobs by user. It also checks for scheduled jobs for the computer under

/etc/crontab and in the /etc/cron.d directory.

Here is the format of a line in crontab. Each of these columns is explained in more detail:

#minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week, command

* * * * * command

Entries in a crontab Command Line

Field Value

Minute 0-59Hour Based on a 24-hour clock; for example, 23 = 11 p.m.
