What is JKS extension?
Java Key Store

Java uses its KeyStore class and related API to make use of a keystore (whether it's file based or not). JKS is a Java-specific file format, but the API can also be used with other file types, typically PKCS#12. When you want to load a keystore, you must specify its keystore type. The conventional extensions would be:

.jks for type "JKS",
.p12 or .pfx for type "PKCS12" (the specification name is PKCS#12, but the # is not used in the Java keystore type name).
In addition, BouncyCastle also provides its implementations, in particular BKS (typically using the .bks extension), which is frequently used for Android applications.
